// Return underlying UIImage to be displayed

// already decompressed) and needs to be loaded from a source (cache, file, web, etc)
// IMPORTANT: You should *NOT* use this method to initiate
// fetching of images from any external of source. That should be handled
// in -loadUnderlyingImageAndNotify: which may be called by the photo browser if this
// methods returns nil.

// Called when the browser has determined the underlying images is not
// already loaded into memory but needs it.
// You must load the image asyncronously (and decompress it for better performance).
// It is recommended that you use SDWebImageDecoder to perform the decompression.
// See MWPhoto object for an example implementation.
// When the underlying UIImage is loaded (or failed to load) you should post the following
// notification:
//
// [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:MWPHOTO_LOADING_DID_END_NOTIFICATION
//                                                     object:self];

// This is called when the photo browser has determined the photo data
// is no longer needed or there are low memory conditions
// You should release any underlying (possibly large and decompressed) image data
// as long as the image can be re-loaded (from cache, file, or URL)
